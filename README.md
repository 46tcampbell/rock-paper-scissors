I will be keeping psuedocode notes here, but all action will take place in the console. Psuedocode below by step:

Step 2: Write the logic to get the computer choice (write a function that randomly returns “rock”, “paper” or “scissors”)

    Create a new function named getComputerChoice
    Code a random selector
    Assign return values to random selector (“rock”, “paper” or “scissors”)
    Print value 
    
Step 3: Write the logic to get the human choice (write a function that takes the user choice and returns it.)

    Create a new function named getHumanChoice.
    User inputs choice
    choice is stored in variable
    choice is printed

Step 4: Declare the players score variables (write variables to keep track of the players score.)

    Create two new variables named humanScore and computerScore in the global scope.
    Start variables with 0
